# Product Mission

## Pitch
Kirsten Siebach's Academic Portfolio is a professional website platform that helps academic researchers, students, and speaking event organizers connect with Dr. Siebach's work by providing an authoritative, up-to-date hub for research, publications, teaching resources, and lab activities. The site enables autonomous content management without technical expertise while maintaining professional credibility that attracts international speaking opportunities.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Students**: Current students enrolled in Dr. Siebach's classes who need quick access to course materials, resources, and external links
- **Speaking Event Organizers**: Conference organizers, universities, and institutions evaluating Dr. Siebach's research and expertise for speaking engagements
- **Scientific Community**: Researchers, collaborators, and peers who want to stay informed about publications, research projects, and lab activities

### User Personas

**Emily - Undergraduate Student** (19-22)
- **Role:** Enrolled in Dr. Siebach's planetary geology course
- **Context:** Needs quick access to course materials, assignment links, and supplementary resources during semester
- **Pain Points:** Can't find class resources quickly; external links are hard to locate; unclear where to access course materials
- **Goals:** Access all class resources from one centralized location without navigating through university portals

**Dr. Martinez - Conference Organizer** (35-55)
- **Role:** Program chair for international planetary science conference
- **Context:** Evaluating potential keynote speakers based on research impact and speaking expertise
- **Pain Points:** Needs to quickly assess research portfolio, recent publications, and speaking experience
- **Goals:** Find comprehensive overview of research focus, publication record, and evidence of speaking ability

**Dr. Siebach - Site Owner** (Academic Researcher)
- **Role:** Associate Professor managing active research lab while teaching courses
- **Context:** Limited time to maintain website; currently requires software engineer for all content updates
- **Pain Points:** Cannot independently update site content; delays in publishing lab news and research updates; dependent on developer availability
- **Goals:** Update website content autonomously without technical knowledge; keep research and lab information current; maintain professional appearance

## The Problem

### Content Management Bottleneck
Currently, all website updates require intervention from a software engineer, creating delays and reducing Dr. Siebach's autonomy. Simple content changes like adding class resources, updating research descriptions, or posting lab updates cannot be done independently. This dependency slows down communication with students and the scientific community, and prevents timely updates that keep the site relevant and engaging.

**Our Solution:** Implement a full-featured block-style editor that enables autonomous page editing with rich WYSIWYG capabilities, image upload, and link management - eliminating developer dependency entirely.

### Scattered Student Resources
Students lack a centralized location for class materials, forcing them to search through multiple platforms or request links repeatedly. This creates friction in the learning experience and increases administrative burden.

**Our Solution:** Create a dedicated Resources page with organized file uploads, document management, and categorization by class/topic for easy student access.

### Disconnected Research and Publications
Research projects and their associated publications exist as separate entities on the site, making it difficult for visitors to understand which publications relate to specific research initiatives. This weakens the narrative connecting research goals to scientific outputs.

**Our Solution:** Implement tagging system that links publications and conference abstracts to research projects, with automatic filtering and display under each research initiative.

### Outdated Professional Appearance
The current Bootstrap-basic design doesn't reflect the professional credibility expected of an accomplished academic researcher. A dated appearance may impact perception among speaking event organizers and the broader scientific community.

**Our Solution:** Comprehensive frontend redesign with modern, professional styling that conveys academic authority while maintaining usability.

### Limited Lab Community Engagement
The site lacks visual engagement showing the human side of research - lab gatherings, conference attendance, team activities, and day-to-day research life. This misses opportunities to attract prospective students and showcase lab culture.

**Our Solution:** Create dedicated Lab Life section featuring photo galleries, Instagram integration, or visual updates that humanize the research experience and build community engagement.

## Differentiators

### Academic-First Content Management
Unlike generic CMS platforms that require technical expertise or offer overly simplified editors, our solution provides academic researchers with professional-grade content control tailored to scholarly needs. Faculty can independently manage complex content including publications, research descriptions, and course materials without compromising on presentation quality or requiring developer intervention.

### Research-Publication Intelligence
While typical academic websites treat publications as flat lists, we create meaningful connections between research initiatives and their scientific outputs. Visitors can explore research projects and immediately see related publications, abstracts, and conference presentations - telling a cohesive story of research impact.

### Proven Speaking Opportunity Generator
This platform has already successfully generated international speaking engagements. The combination of comprehensive research showcase, professional presentation, and up-to-date content creates credibility that attracts high-value opportunities - demonstrating measurable career impact beyond simple web presence.
