# Phase 7.1: User Resource Implementation

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned Role:** filament-specialist
**Duration:** ~15 minutes

## Overview

Successfully created a fully functional User resource in Filament with role assignment capabilities, password hashing, email validation, and search functionality. The resource allows admins to manage users with proper security controls.

## Implementation Steps

### 7.1.1: Write User Resource Tests

**File:** `tests/Feature/UserResourceTest.php`

Created 4 focused tests covering critical user management functionality:

1. **test_user_can_be_created_with_valid_data()** - Tests user creation with valid data and password hashing
2. **test_email_must_be_unique()** - Tests email uniqueness constraint
3. **test_password_is_hashed()** - Verifies password hashing works correctly
4. **test_user_can_be_assigned_role()** - Tests role assignment integration

**Test Results:** All 4 tests passed (6 assertions)

### 7.1.2: Generate User Resource

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource User --generate
```

**Result:** Filament generated a complete resource structure:
- `app/Filament/Resources/Users/UserResource.php` - Main resource class
- `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Schemas/UserForm.php` - Form schema
- `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Tables/UsersTable.php` - Table configuration
- `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Pages/ListUsers.php` - List page
- `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Pages/CreateUser.php` - Create page
- `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Pages/EditUser.php` - Edit page

### 7.1.3: Configure User Resource Fields

**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Schemas/UserForm.php`

Configured form with the following fields:

```php
TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->maxLength(255),

TextInput::make('email')
    ->email()
    ->required()
    ->maxLength(254)
    ->unique(ignoreRecord: true),  // Ensures email uniqueness, ignoring current record on update

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->required(fn (string $context): bool => $context === 'create')  // Required only on create
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn ($state) => filled($state) ? Hash::make($state) : null)  // Hash password
    ->dehydrated(fn ($state) => filled($state))  // Only save if filled
    ->minLength(8)
    ->maxLength(255),

Select::make('roles')
    ->relationship('roles', 'name')
    ->preload()
    ->searchable()
    ->label('Role'),
```

**Key Features:**
- Password is required only when creating (not when editing)
- Password is automatically hashed before saving
- Email uniqueness is enforced (ignores current record during updates)
- Role selection integrated with Spatie Permission
- All fields have proper validation

### 7.1.4: Configure User Resource Table

**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Users/Tables/UsersTable.php`

Configured table with the following columns:

```php
TextColumn::make('id')
    ->sortable()
    ->searchable(),

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->sortable()
    ->searchable(),

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->sortable()
    ->searchable(),

TextColumn::make('roles.name')
    ->badge()
    ->label('Role'),

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()
    ->sortable()
    ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true),

TextColumn::make('updated_at')
    ->dateTime()
    ->sortable()
    ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true),
```

**Key Features:**
- ID, name, and email are searchable and sortable
- Role displayed as badge for visual distinction
- Timestamps hidden by default but toggleable
- Edit action available for each row
- Bulk delete action available

### 7.1.5: Enable Search

Search is enabled on the following fields:
- ID
- Name
- Email

Users can search by typing in the search box at the top of the table.

### 7.1.6: Configure Navigation

**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Users/UserResource.php`

```php
protected static ?string $model = User::class;
protected static string|BackedEnum|null $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-users';
```

- Icon: Users icon (`heroicon-o-users`)
- Appears in main navigation sidebar
- Accessible only to admin users (protected by Phase 6 middleware)

1. `Authenticate` middleware (must be logged in)
2. `EnsureUserHasAdminRole` middleware (must have admin role)

## Test Results

```
✓ user can be created with valid data
✓ email must be unique
✓ password is hashed
✓ user can be assigned role

Tests:    4 passed (6 assertions)
Duration: 0.35s
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] User resource visible in Filament navigation
- [x] Form renders correctly with all fields
- [x] Password is hashed when creating user
- [x] Email uniqueness is enforced
- [x] Password is optional when editing (only updates if filled)

## Integration with Phase 6 (Permissions)

The User resource integrates seamlessly with the permission system:

1. **Role Assignment:** Users can be assigned the 'admin' role via the form
2. **Access Control:** Only admin users can manage users
3. **Role Display:** User roles displayed as badges in table
4. **Spatie Integration:** Uses `roles` relationship from HasRoles trait
