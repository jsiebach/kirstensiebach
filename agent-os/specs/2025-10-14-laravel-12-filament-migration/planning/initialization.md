# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
**Feature Name:** Laravel 12 & Filament 4 Migration

**Description:**
Upgrade the application from Laravel 10 to Laravel 12, and replace Laravel Nova 4.33 with Laravel Filament 4 for the admin panel. This is a foundational migration that will enable better content management capabilities and remove the dependency on the Nova license.

Key components:
- Laravel Framework upgrade: 10.x → 12.x
- Admin panel replacement: Nova 4.33 → Filament 4
- Remove all Nova-specific packages and dependencies
- Ensure PHP 8.4 compatibility
- Maintain existing functionality while preparing for new features

Create the appropriately dated spec folder (YYYY-MM-DD-laravel-12-filament-migration format) and provide the full path to the spec folder.
