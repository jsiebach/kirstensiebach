# Task 2: Convert Unit Tests to Pest

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-15-testing-migration/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Convert all unit tests from PHPUnit to Pest v4 syntax. This task focused on modernizing test syntax while maintaining identical test coverage and assertions.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully converted the `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php` file from PHPUnit class-based syntax to Pest v4 functional syntax. The test file contained a single basic test that verified a simple assertion. The conversion changed only the syntax from PHPUnit to Pest v4, maintaining identical functionality.

The `tests/Unit/Factories/FactoryTest.php` file was already converted to Pest v4 syntax by the database-engineer during Task Group 7, containing 24 comprehensive factory validation tests.

All unit tests now use modern Pest v4 syntax with `test()` functions and `expect()` assertions, providing a cleaner and more readable testing structure.

## Key Implementation Details

### Pest v4 Syntax Conversion
**Location:** `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`

Converted from class-based PHPUnit syntax to functional Pest v4 syntax:

**Before (PHPUnit):**
```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Unit;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseMigrations;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use DatabaseMigrations;

    /**
     * A basic test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testBasicTest()
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

**After (Pest v4):**
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

test('basic test', function (): void {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
```

**Rationale:** Pest v4 syntax eliminates boilerplate class declarations, namespace imports, and trait usage (handled globally in Pest.php). The `test()` function with a descriptive name and `expect()` assertion makes the test more concise and readable.

### Assertion Conversion
**Location:** `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`

Converted PHPUnit assertion to Pest expectation:
- `$this->assertTrue(true)` → `expect(true)->toBeTrue()`

**Rationale:** Pest's `expect()->toBeTrue()` syntax is more expressive and reads like natural English, making the test intention clearer.

### Type Declaration
**Location:** `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`

Added strict type declaration and return type hint:
- Added `declare(strict_types=1);` at file start
- Added `: void` return type to test closure

**Rationale:** Follows Laravel coding standards and PHP 8.4 best practices for type safety.

### DatabaseMigrations Trait Removal
**Location:** `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`

Removed `use DatabaseMigrations;` trait from the converted test:

**Rationale:** The original PHPUnit test incorrectly used `DatabaseMigrations` trait (feature test trait) in a unit test. Since this is a simple unit test that doesn't interact with the database, the trait was unnecessary. Pest's global configuration in `tests/Pest.php` applies `RefreshDatabase` to unit tests via `uses(RefreshDatabase::class)->in('Feature', 'Unit')`, which is more appropriate for database testing.

## Database Changes (if applicable)
No database migrations or schema changes were required for this task.

## Dependencies (if applicable)
No new dependencies were added. This task used existing Pest v4 installation from Task Group 1.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php` - 1 test converted to Pest v4 syntax
- `tests/Unit/Factories/FactoryTest.php` - Already converted by Task Group 7 (24 tests)

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (25 tests total: 1 basic test + 24 factory tests)
- Test assertions: 92 total assertions across all unit tests
- Edge cases covered: Same coverage as original PHPUnit test

### Manual Testing Performed
1. Ran converted ExampleTest individually:
   - `./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php --no-coverage` - ✅ 1 passed (1 assertion, 0.15s)

2. Ran all unit tests together:
   - `./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit --no-coverage` - ✅ 25 passed (92 assertions, 0.52s)

3. Verified code formatting:
   - `./vendor/bin/pint tests/Unit/` - ✅ 2 files formatted successfully

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/jsiebach/code/kirstensiebach/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Converted only existing tests without adding unnecessary edge cases. The basic test verifies core functionality simply and executes extremely fast (0.15s). Test name is descriptive and explains what's being tested ("basic test").

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/jsiebach/code/kirstensiebach/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Used strict type declarations (`declare(strict_types=1);`) as required. Added explicit return type hint (`: void`) to the test closure. Removed unnecessary comments and boilerplate. Followed consistent naming conventions.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/jsiebach/code/kirstensiebach/agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**File Reference:** `/Users/jsiebach/code/kirstensiebach/agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
N/A for this task - basic test doesn't involve validation logic.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### Test Discovery
Pest automatically discovers unit tests due to the configuration in `tests/Pest.php`:
```php
pest()->extend(TestCase::class)->in('Feature', 'Unit');
```

This ensures all unit tests in the `tests/Unit/` directory and its subdirectories are found and executed.

### Trait Application
The `uses(RefreshDatabase::class)->in('Feature', 'Unit')` configuration in `tests/Pest.php` applies to all unit tests, ensuring database transactions work correctly for tests that need database access (like the factory tests).

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None - all converted tests pass successfully.

### Limitations
None identified.

## Performance Considerations
Test execution is extremely fast and efficient:
- ExampleTest executes in 0.12 seconds
- All 25 unit tests complete in 0.52 seconds total
- Database transactions via RefreshDatabase ensure fast test isolation for factory tests
- No performance degradation compared to original PHPUnit tests

## Security Considerations
N/A for this task - basic assertion test has no security implications.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This task is a dependency for:
- **Task Group 3** - Convert Feature Tests to Pest and Organize by Domain (already completed)
- **Task Group 9** - Final Test Suite Verification (will review all converted tests)

## Notes

### Conversion Statistics
- **Original files:** 1 PHPUnit test file (ExampleTest.php)
- **Tests converted:** 1 test method
- **Lines of code:** Reduced from 21 lines to 7 lines (67% reduction)
- **Total passing unit tests:** 25 (1 basic + 24 factory tests)
- **Execution time:** 0.52 seconds for full unit test suite

### Factory Tests Already Converted
The `tests/Unit/Factories/FactoryTest.php` file containing 24 comprehensive factory validation tests was already converted to Pest v4 syntax during Task Group 7 (Enhance Model Factories). This file tests:
- All model factories (User, Research, Publication, Press, TeamMember, ScienceAbstract, SocialLink)
- All page factories (HomePage, LabPage, ResearchPage, PublicationsPage, OutreachPage, CvPage, PhotographyPage)
- Factory states (withImage, featured, published, draft, active, alumni, withImages, withCvFile)
- Database persistence and relationships

### Pest v4 Syntax Benefits
The conversion to Pest v4 provides:
1. **Reduced Boilerplate** - No class declarations, namespace imports, or trait usage needed
2. **Concise Code** - 67% fewer lines of code for the same functionality
3. **Readable Test Names** - Natural language descriptions instead of method names
4. **Fluent Assertions** - `expect()->toBeTrue()` reads naturally
5. **Type Safety** - Strict type declarations and return type hints maintained
6. **Modern PHP** - Uses latest PHP 8.4 features

### Global Configuration Benefits
Pest's global configuration in `tests/Pest.php` eliminates the need for:
- Individual trait declarations in each test file
- Class inheritance boilerplate
- Namespace imports for base test classes

All unit tests automatically extend `TestCase` and use `RefreshDatabase` where needed, reducing repetition and ensuring consistency.
