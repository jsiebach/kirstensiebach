# Task Breakdown: Testing Infrastructure Migration

## Overview
Total Task Groups: 9
Assigned Implementers: backend-engineer, database-engineer, testing-engineer, filament-specialist, devops-engineer

## Project Context
This Laravel 10 + Filament 4 application is migrating from mixed PHPUnit/Playwright testing to a modern Pest-based infrastructure with pest-plugin-browser tests. The migration focuses on:
- Deleting Playwright tests entirely
- Converting existing PHPUnit tests to Pest v4 in place
- Building comprehensive browser tests from scratch for Filament admin and frontend verification
- Enhancing model factories for robust test data generation
- Updating CI/CD workflows for the new testing infrastructure
